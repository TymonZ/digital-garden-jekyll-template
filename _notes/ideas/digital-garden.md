### What is a digital garden

As with many other internet-born terms, the exact definition of digital garden is unclear.
But there are several principles of garden development that most of the community agree on, with are:

* Valuing process of creation more than the result (letting ideas grow ðŸŒ±).

* Abandoning chierarchical structure of the website.

* Developing garden in non-linear fashion, similar to the way people naturally explore content of websites.

Usually digital gardens are minimalistic sites created personally in free time, with resembles the way old-school pre-corporacional web was developed.
