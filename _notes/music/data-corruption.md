Data Corruption / Why It Takes Out So Long EP is a journey through the deserted world of pandemic.
Album is full of repetitive melodies and soundscapes being processed thru digital distortion and change of context. Music in combination with
graphic design by Radzikows allows you to contemplate the current situation and reflect on our place in the chaos that surrounds us.
