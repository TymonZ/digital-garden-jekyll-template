Automaton EP is an ode to first decades of existence of internet designed with soundsystems in mind.
Album combines 90's breaks with dub techno chords and pads influenced by music of [Theorem](https://soundcloud.com/theorem-thx) and [Organit](https://tamas-olejnik.bandcamp.com), creating organic and dystopian atmosphere.
