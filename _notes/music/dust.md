My debiut album, including an award winnig track - Dust.

>"In Dust Tymon created a rhythmic ambient landscape in which the sounds of old machines are mixed with non-human nature."
-- [Culture.pl](https://culture.pl/pl/artykul/sepr-sample-9-zwyciezcy-konkursu)

The core of the album are [samples](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/sounds-polish-radio-experimental-studio/) from compositions of [Polish Radio Experimental Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Radio_Experimental_Studio) - pioneers of electronic music under the iron curtain - and obscure field recordings found in depth of the Internet.
