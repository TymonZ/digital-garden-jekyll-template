I managed to get some time to work on a breadboard prototype of Huginn. The power input from my Doepfer A-100 DIY Kit #1 PSU was jumping between diferrent voltages, but other modules are working just fine. I think I need to add a voltage regulator; I'm looking for possible solutions on [r/synthdiy](https://reddit.com/r/synthdiy) right now.
