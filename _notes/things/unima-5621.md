Function generator created by Polish association of electronics manufacturers Unitra in 1989. Model 5621 have frequency range from 0.005 Hz to 5.5 MHz. The most unusual feature for this type of test equipment is logarythmic VCO CV input, whith I find useful for performing with [modular setup](/things/system).

I remember there was a scan of manual somwhere on internet, but sadly I can'y find it.
