# Index

I created this [[digital garden]] as a place to document my learning process, reposiory for my thoughts and resource aggregator. Topics I usually write about, are electronic music, procedural generation and web design. Sometimes I also upload photos of nature.

If you don't know where to start, you can start somewhere here:

* [[tools]]

* [[thoughts]]

* [[music]]

* [[visual]]

* [[links]]

* [[about]]

Feel free to explore the site, and [mail me](mailto:tymon.zaniewski.pl@gmail.com) if you want to ask about something, or just wanna chat.
